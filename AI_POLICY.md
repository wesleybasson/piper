# PipeR AI Usage Policy

Purpose
- This policy describes acceptable use of AI-assisted coding tools (for example GitHub Copilot, OpenAI ChatGPT, and similar systems) when contributing to PipeR. It is intended to encourage productive use of assistance while ensuring human responsibility for code quality, security, and intellectual property.

Scope
- Applies to all contributors working on code, tests, documentation, and infrastructure in this repository.

Allowed uses
- Use AI tools for suggestions, code snippets, refactor ideas, documentation drafts, and test generation.
- Use AI to speed up routine tasks, explore possible implementations, or learn about APIs and patterns.

Restrictions and rules
- Do not allow AI to autonomously modify the repository or introduce new features without explicit human oversight and approval.
- Never paste secrets, credentials, or other sensitive or private data into public or external AI services.
- Treat AI output as untrusted: all AI-generated code must be reviewed, tested, and verified by a human developer before being merged.
- Contributors should document AI usage in the pull request description (brief note: what was generated, which tool was used, and what validation was performed).

Review and approval
- Reviewers must validate correctness, performance, security, licensing, and alignment with project style and architecture.
- Prefer small, focused PRs for AI-assisted changes to make review easier.

Security and intellectual property
- AI outputs may reflect patterns derived from public training data. Reviewers should verify that suggested code does not introduce licensing conflicts or inadvertent copying of third-party code.

Contact and reporting
- If you identify a security concern related to AI usage or an accidental leak of sensitive data to an external service, follow `SECURITY.md` and contact the maintainers immediately.
