# Security

If you discover a security vulnerability in PipeR, please report it privately to the maintainers so we can address it before public disclosure.

Responsible disclosure
- Email: `wesley@litheon.co.za` (replace with an appropriate contact email)
- If you prefer, open a private issue and mark it `security` (or use the repository's private reporting channel).

What to include
- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce (minimal test case if possible)
- A suggested mitigation or fix, if you have one

We will respond as soon as possible and coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline.
