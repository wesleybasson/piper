# Contributing to PipeR

Thanks for your interest in contributing to PipeR! We welcome contributions of all kinds - bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, and code.

## How to contribute

- Fork the repository and create a branch named with the pattern: `feature/<short-description>` or `fix/<short-description>`.
- Make sure your branch is based on `main`.
- Keep changes small and focused; include tests for behavior changes.

## Development workflow

- Run `dotnet build PipeR.sln` to build the solution.
- Run `dotnet test` to execute tests.
- Run code formatters used by the project (e.g., `dotnet format`) before opening a PR.

## Pull request process

- Open a pull request (PR) against the repository's default branch.
- Include a clear title and description, mention related issues, and provide testing steps.
- Label breaking changes and update `CHANGELOG.md` where appropriate.

## Code style

- Follow standard C# conventions used in the project and keep formatting consistent with existing files.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness. Write tests for public behavior.

## Commit messages

- Use short, imperative style: `Add`, `Fix`, `Update`, `Remove`.

## Communication

- For major design changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach.
- If you find a security issue, follow `SECURITY.md` to report it privately.

## AI tools

- Developers may use AI code assistance (for example, GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT) to help with coding, documentation, tests, and learning.
- AI must not be allowed to autonomously change the repository or introduce new features without explicit developer authority.
- Any code, tests, or significant text generated by AI must be thoroughly reviewed, tested, and approved by a human developer before merging.
- When a PR includes AI-generated content, the PR description should include a short note describing what was generated by AI and what review/validation was performed.
- Avoid pasting secrets, credentials, proprietary, or sensitive data into external AI services.
- Reviewers should validate that AI-generated code complies with licensing, security, and project style requirements.

See `AI_POLICY.md` for the full AI usage policy and links to external resources.
